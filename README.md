# Hedgehog

### Introduction

**Hedgehog** is an on-chain lending protocol built on the Hedera network that uniquely utilizes tokenized Real World Shares from stock exchanges as collateral. By bridging traditional finance with decentralized technology, Hedgehog offers a secure, transparent, and efficient way to leverage real-world assets within the blockchain ecosystem.

The protocol transforms physical shares into fungible tokens, allowing users to deposit these tokenized assets and borrow against them. With the integration of a real-time price oracle and dynamic liquidity management, Hedgehog ensures that collateral values are always up to date, mitigating risks associated with market volatility.

Key features include:

* **Tokenization of Real World Shares:** Each token represents a one-to-one claim on shares held in reserve, ensuring asset-backed stability.
* **Seamless Integration on Hedera:** Leveraging the speed, security, and scalability of the Hedera network, Hedgehog provides a robust on-chain experience.
* **Dynamic Collateral Management:** With automated price updates and strict withdrawal limits, the protocol maintains optimal liquidity and safeguards user assets.
* **Over-Collateralized Lending:** Users can borrow up to 80% of the value of their deposited tokens, ensuring a buffer against market fluctuations.
* **Robust Risk Controls:** Features such as circuit break triggers and unsolvability conditions are built into the protocol to prevent systemic failures during market stress.

This innovative approach not only enhances liquidity for traditional assets but also opens up new avenues for investors seeking to participate in both traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). The following sections will detail the system architecture, operational mechanisms, and control measures that make Hedgehog a pioneering solution in the evolving financial landscape.
