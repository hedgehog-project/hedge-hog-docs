# Price Oracle

The PriceOracle is a critical component of the Hedgehog Lending Protocol. It functions as an off-chain price feed that is continuously maintained and updated by our team to reflect the latest market valuations of tokenized shares in USDC. Its key roles include:

* **Real-Time Valuation:**\
  The PriceOracle receives live data from various market sources, converting the current market price of each share into its USDC equivalent. This ensures that every tokenâ€™s value is represented accurately and in real time.
* **Seamless Integration with the Issuer:**\
  By constantly updating the PriceOracle contract, the system enables the Issuer contract to have immediate access to current token valuations. This integration is crucial during the minting (buying) and burning (selling) processes, as it guarantees that token transactions are executed at fair, market-reflective prices.
* **Risk Management and Liquidity Assurance:**\
  The continuous price updates help maintain system stability by ensuring that collateral values are always current. This dynamic tracking aids in managing over-collateralization ratios and triggers liquidity adjustments when necessary, safeguarding against market volatility.
* **Transparency and Trust:**\
  With a consistent, real-time feed, the PriceOracle provides a transparent mechanism for price verification. Users and stakeholders can trust that all on-chain transactions involving tokenized assets are based on the most recent market data available.

In summary, the PriceOracle underpins the entire pricing mechanism within the Hedgehog Lending Protocol, providing essential data that drives the accuracy and reliability of asset valuations, and thereby, the overall integrity of the lending process.
